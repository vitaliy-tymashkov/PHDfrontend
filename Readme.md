#### In this PoC PHD frontend is presented with use of jQuery and CSS.
You may find in console some logs of execution of javascript.

* Get time manually from worldtimeapi.org button - use it to manually update time
* TT0001.PV - is not updated manually - just to show blinking (offscan)
* TT0220.PV and TT0221.PV tags are updated based on current time seconds (but due to float has a long fraction sometimes - output value is cut to 4 chars). Also each value is incremented with index of this tag.
